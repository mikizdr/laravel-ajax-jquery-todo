# Laravel-AJAX-jQuery To Do list

  Simple CRUD todo list app in Laravel with AJAX and jQuery toghether and simple search engine.

  Clone this project (this is done in XAMPP htdocs folder, because of some errors for POST method). You also need the rest of the laravel project files that are ignored in .git ignore. Make migration to database and run command from the project folder

  <strong>php -S localhost:3303 -t public</strong>
  
  Go to the your browser and type localhost:3303 in address bar. (if you want the other port to run app on just type that port number and make change in list.blade.php in 155th row - source: 'http://localhost:3303/search'.
  
That\`s all.
