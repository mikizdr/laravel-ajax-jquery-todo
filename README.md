# Laravel-AJAX-jQuery To Do list

  Simple CRUD todo list app in Laravel with AJAX and jQuery toghether and simple search engine.

  Clone this project (this is done in XAMPP htdocs folder, because of some errors for POST method; maybe you will not experience them if you clone the project on you Deskto for exam.).
  You will also need the rest of the laravel project, so rename .env.example to .env and configure database in .end file.
  Run:
  <b>composer update</b>
  
  Make migratione with:
  <b>php artisan migrate</b>
 
  Run the next command from the project folder:
  <strong>php -S localhost:3303 -t public</strong>
  
  Go to the your browser and type localhost:3303 in address bar. (if you want the other port to run app on just type that port number and make change in list.blade.php in 155th row - source: 'http://localhost:3303/search'.
  
That\`s all.
